Q2: We have a table with employees and their salaries, however, some of the records are old and contain outdated salary information. Find the current salary of each employee assuming that salaries increase each year. Output their id, first name, last name, department ID, and current salary. Order your list by employee ID in ascending order.

Table: ms_employee_salary

Code:
select
    id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id,
    max(salary) as current_salary
    from ms_employee_salary e
    group by
        id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        department_id
    order by id ASC
;

Output:
id	first_name	last_name	department_id	current_salary
1	Todd	Wilson	1006	110000
